Relational DataBase -
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.
In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. 
The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute,
making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

Tables can also have many columns of data. Columns are labeled with a descriptive name  and have a specific data type.
